- **AI Model**: Google's Gemini-1.5-flash
- **Additional Libraries**: 
  - google-generativeai
  - python-dotenv
  - pydantic
  - uvicorn

## Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # Streamlit frontend application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py            # FastAPI backend server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ marking_ps_gemini.py # Problem statement evaluation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # Project dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ streamlit_and_fast.py # Combined Streamlit and FastAPI implementation
```

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
